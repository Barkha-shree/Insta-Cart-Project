# Insta-Cart-Project
The dataset for this project is a relational set of files describing customers' orders over time. The goal of the project is to predict which products will be in a user's next order.

The dataset is anonymized and contains a sample of over 3 million grocery orders from more than 200,000 Instacart users. For each user, we are provided between 4 and 100 of their orders, with the sequence of products purchased in each order. We are also provided the week and hour of day the order was placed, and a relative measure of time between orders.
